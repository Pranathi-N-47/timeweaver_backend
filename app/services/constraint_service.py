Constraint Service - Validation and Weight Calculation

Validates hard constraints (must be satisfied) and calculates soft constraint
weights for optimization.

Hard Constraints:
- Room capacity >= Section student count
- Lab courses → Lab rooms only
- PE/FE synchronization (same time for all sections in same year/dept)

Soft Constraints (weights 0-1):
- Home room preference: 0.9 weight
- Faculty preference: 0.8 weight
